# Emotions in Motion ~ A comment creator for the Soul. ðŸ˜‡
Emotions in Motion is a place for the mind, body, and soul. This is a mental
health app that is geared towards inspiring others. Come join us and feel
inspired by Emotions in Motion!
## Planning Story
Emotions in Motion is a quote that has inspired me. It encapsulates my passion
towards self growth. It reminds me that mental health is one of the most
overlooked issues in our society.

Ever since I started learning about coding, I wanted to create an app that is
both personal and meaningful. The goal of Emotions in Motion is to infuse
awareness that technology can provide a tool for us to support each other
through positivity and mindfulness.

One of the hardest things about this project was to narrow down achievable goals
due to time constraints. Therefore, version one focuses on basic functions (CRUD),
sign-in functions, and extra functions (to like a comment).

I consider that my CSS is the essence of my app because my goal was to create a
warm ambience for the user. The background leans on the idea of motion while
having elements of both light and dark to depict the duality of our emotions.
I've placed the comments in the middle to create a middlepoint in this duality.

## Unsolved Problems/Strived Goals
For future iterations of the Emotions in Motion app, I would like to add more
features such as having an emoji picker where the users have the ability to pick
the emoji's of their choice. I would also like to have a like counter, where the
number of likes for a particular comment or comments are recorded. Lastly,
ensuring the comments created are appropriate and meet the apps standards.
